The following analyses were performed in support of [Right to Counsel's](https://www.righttocounselnyc.org/) annual State of Evictions fact sheet. 

## Cumulative Eviction Filings

Number of eviction filings from January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2025

```{sql connection = con, output.var = "eviction_count_df", cache = TRUE}
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT indexnumberid)::integer
FROM oca_index
WHERE fileddate >= MAKE_DATE(2020,1,1) 
  AND fileddate <= MAKE_DATE(2025,12,31)
  AND classification IN ('Holdover', 'Non-Payment');
```

In New York State, there were **`r scales::comma(eviction_count_df$count)`** eviction-oriented (holdover and non-payment) filings from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2025.

## Annual eviction filings
```{sql connection = con, output.var = "eviction_count_annual_df", cache = TRUE}
SELECT
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fileddate) AS filed_year,
	COUNT(DISTINCT indexnumberid)::integer
FROM oca_index
WHERE fileddate >= MAKE_DATE(2020,1,1) 
  AND fileddate <= MAKE_DATE(2025,12,31)
  AND classification IN ('Holdover', 'Non-Payment')
GROUP BY filed_year;
```

The number of eviction-related (holdover and non-payment) eviction filings per year is:

```{r}
eviction_count_annual_table <- eviction_count_annual_df |> 
  flextable() |> 
  set_table_properties(width = 1, layout = "autofit") |>
